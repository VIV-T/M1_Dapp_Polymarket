Here are the commands to run the project:

- "truffle init" in the main folder: create the base architecture to deploy the contracts (DONE)
- "npm init -f" in the client folder: initialize the frontend project (DONE)

- "npm install": install all required dependencies (ESSENTIAL TO RUN - dependencies are not checked into git).
  -> Run this command at the repository root and inside the `client/` folder.

- "truffle compile": compile the smart contracts
- "truffle migrate --reset --network development": deploy the contracts for the dapp
- "truffle test": run tests (not tried in this project yet)

To run the frontend:
- "npm run deploy": deploy the smart contracts and copy artifacts into the frontend
- update the contract address in `client/src/utils/web3.js` with the address from Ganache
- "npm start": start the frontend app


App specifications:

The application contains two separate views:
 - Personal: shows information related to the current user
 - Global: shows information from the blockchain (all markets)

Each view contains three tabs:
 - Active: markets that are open for betting
 - Pending: markets that are past their deadline and waiting for resolution (UMA oracle)
 - Resolved: markets that finished and where users have been paid

Additional rules:
 - Anyone can create new bets/markets and must provide these fields:
    - title
    - option 1
    - option 2
 - Active markets have an end datetime; when it elapses the market becomes "Pending" waiting for resolution
 - Win probability (%) is computed from the number of bettors and amounts; it is updated in real time each time a bet is placed
 - Pending markets rely on the UMA oracle for resolution: users vote/commit with an amount of Ether. Challenges are possible to avoid cheating
 - When a market becomes resolved, winning bettors are paid from the losing pool; rewards are added to their wallet balance

The profile view (in addition to the three tabs) filters to only show markets the user participated in and includes a profile section where the user's info is displayed (name, account, wallet balance, etc.)
